## Keep Awake Web

Keep Awake Web is a widget designed to prevent phone displays from going into sleep mode while using web browsers on
Android and iOS devices.

## Usage

To enable the Keep Awake functionality on your web pages, simply add the widget into the pages where you want to prevent
the display from sleeping. The widget will take care of the rest.

## Limitations

Due to certain browsers limitations, atleast one click interaction is required before the widget is activated. A way to make sure the widget is always activated you could for example add it to a layout.
